# Executive Summary

The definitions used in the legislation mirror the definitions used by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in their autonomous vehicle policy. These definitions clarify terms used to describe autonomous vehicles and vehicle operators to avoid potential confusion with current driving legislation. Additionally, the levels of automation are defined according to the Society of Automovite Engineer (SAE) International’s J3016 standard. These levels of automation describe categorical distinctions for a step-wise progression from autonomous level zero to level five.

Our bill includes a requirement for the Department of Licensing (DOL) to maintain a database of SAE Level autonomous capabilities for vehicles registered in the state. This is to be indicated both on the vehicle’s yearly registration and license plate. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure drivers have ample notice of the capabilities (and limitations) of their vehicles, and provide general notice to others around the vehicles of their autonomous capabilities. Additionally, the Department of Licensing, Washington State Patrol, and Department of Transportation are collectively empowered to temporarily suspend an autonomous registration where a safety-critical vulnerability has been identified with a particular model, until such issue can be patched. This will ensure Washington residents can safely begin to take advantage of the benefits of autonomous transportation, while maintaining capabilities for a quick state response to any technological challenges.

To encourage safe technological innovation, our proposed testing regime is designed to promote public safety and responsible vehicle testing. Since vehicles currently tested by manufacturers are being operated and maintained by trained professionals, there are fewer requirements than if the vehicle is operated by the general public. Manufacturers will receive a testing permit upon submission of required documentation. Failure to adhere to parameters of issuance, or testing beyond that specified in the application (without amendment) is subject to fine or loss of testing license.

The bill creates the Committee for Autonomous Technologies, Safety, and Cybersecurity (CyberCATS) with a double aim: (1) to facilitate coordination among agents involved in the deployment of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) within Washington State, and (2) to produce recommendations to guide the transition from the traditional transportation means towards intelligent transport systems. An early policy response from CyberCATS will shape how AV technology can be used to benefit Washington State.

The bill reinforces privacy protections for AV’s users. With our proposal, the user will know exactly what data and for what purposes is being collected, will know about data breaches, and will have access to data in case of an accident. In addition, data management limitations, data security, and de-identification of personal data policies are introduced. The purpose is to advance transparency, accountability values, and ultimately, consumers’ trust in AVs.

# Narrative Explanation
Autonomous vehicles will be entering the marketplace at an increasing pace. States such as Michigan and Florida have taken the lead by promulgating regulations aimed at the evolving AV market. It is conceivable that an autonomous vehicle manufacturer could operate in Washington without regulation, but in the face of potential litigation during testing phases, certainty provides a substantial incentive.

## Framework

In order to provide the reassurance sought by consumers and the certainty sought by manufacturers, the legislation seeks to meet the following objectives:

- Delegate to competent state agencies
- Provide a legal framework for unexpected developments in technology
- Update statutes which do not account for autonomous operation
- Except in matter which autonomous vehicles necessarily differ from standard vehicles, the current regulations should provide a default rule.  

## Exclusion of Mandatory Manual Override

We decided to exclude a mandatory manual override requirement from the general operation requirements, though kept the requirement of an override (software or physical) for testing. 

We decided to exclude a mandatory manual override for the following reasons:
- Requires software to know that it is missing something and "prove the negative"
- Questionable whether humans have the requisite reaction time to respond appropriately in such situations. 
- Does not permit people of limited mobility to make use of the technology.

Furthermore, vehicles of level 3 or lower have an incentive to include a manual override already because the technology cannot be operated in a wide variety of known conditions, such that the vehicle would not be useful without some form of manual control.

For testing purposes, an override makes sense because the actual automation software has not necessarily proven it's capacity for directing that specific type of vehicle. In the short term, a human operator may provide a necessary stopgap measure if the software unexpectedly fails. 

## Definitions
Autonomous vehicles are defined to include SAE level 3 and above to create clear and concise legislation that promotes safety without interfering with current driving laws. Additionally, autonomous vehicle manufacturers include an individual or company that alters or modifies a traditional motor vehicle in addition to original equipment manufacturers. This allows companies to retrofit vehicles for testing promoting innovation in the state, while ensuring safe operation The unique aspects of autonomous vehicles requires “driving” to be redefined. The phrase “dynamic driving task” includes not only the traditional task of “driving” by human input but also technological input. There is additional clarification between the activator of the autonomous functionality and the operator who is in physical control. This clarification prevents confusion as to who is responsible for the vehicle and how that individual should be treated by traditional vehicle laws. The levels of automation are used to describe the distinctions between the different levels of automation, they start from level zero and progress step-wise to level five. The distinctions are taken from the Society for Automotive Engineers International J3016 standard. The levels describe the categorical difference and provide clear division to clarify which requirements will apply to which level of automation.

## Registration

Similar to human-driven vehicles, we anticipate autonomous vehicles will be required to register with the Washington Department of Licensing (DoL). In addition to standard fields collected by DoL on registered vehicles, we propose the DoL maintain a database of autonomous vehicles sold to the public and their associated SAE level of autonomous capabilities (ex. SAE Level 4)[^saelevel]. This is the same standard being utilized by the U.S. Department of Transportation in autonomous vehicle planning.[^vehplan] This number will be published as a field on standard vehicle registration documentation to provide an additional layer of protection for consumers as to the autonomous capability level reported by the manufacturer based on hardware and software configuration. Since this number is subject to change with improved software updates, manufacturers are obligated to notify DoL when an increase in SAE level capability becomes available to the general public (ex. SAE Level 3 to Level 4). The purpose of this notification is to provide the DoL with ample opportunity to update their database, and in turn, the yearly registration sent to Washington motorists. Upon receipt of registration, Washington drivers must mark the registration in some manner indicating they understand their vehicle has autonomous capabilities. This requirement is to ensure motorists are informed of the capabilities (and limitations) of their vehicle.
	
In addition to registration requirements, the DoL is charged with developing a standard notation on Washington license plates to externally signify a vehicle is autonomous and the associated number. This is similar to license plates which designate existing non-standard vehicles classes (ex. Vehicle dealers).[^vehdeal] For example, autonomous license plates may start with a number signifying the SAE Level in an offset color (ex. A gold “4”). This requirement serves several purposes:
- Signify to pedestrians a vehicle is autonomous
- Signify to law enforcement a vehicle is autonomous, especially if driver  is using a cellular device or engaging in other behavior that would be unsafe in a human-driven vehicle
- License plate is more permanent, less aesthetically objectionable that a “sticker” or other forms of notice. (ex. carpool lane sticker)
	
While manufacturers have already completed millions of miles of testing, as with any technology, there will inevitably be issues that develop.[^muchtest] The Washington Department of Transportation, Washington State Patrol, and DoL License plate is more permanent, less aesthetically objectionable that a “sticker” or other forms of notice. (ex. carpool lane sticker) are delegated the authority to designate specific models of autonomous vehicles that temporarily may not be operated on Washington roads due to safety concerns until any issues can be addressed.

## Insurance
The insurance provisions make explicit the different uses for autonomous vehicles by providing broad language to cover four primary groups of users. The actual amounts for insurance mirror the current requirements for insurance for personal or business use in Washington State, using transportation network company insurance guidelines in Seattle as a model for insurance amounts required for the transportation network companies using autonomous vehicles. Related or new models of business could require additional legislation, though the current provisions cover anticipated business models. 

We divided explicitly categorized the insurance into the following logical groups. 

1. The first category is the individual who uses their vehicle only for private functions
    - This individual only requires the minimum state mandatory minimum for insurance
2. The second category is the individual who privately owns a vehicle and also permits their vehicle to be used as part of a ride-sharing or similar scheme.
    - This individual must carry insurance equal to $100,000 (the current minimum for commercial vehicle operaiton)
3. The third category is the corporation that uses a private fleet (for employes only). 
    - the corporation must carry commercial vehicle insurance equal to the statutory mandatory minimum
4. The fourth and final category is the corporation that uses a vehicle for public (taxi or ride-share) services or rental.
    - This category must carry insurance equal to the minimum requirement for manufacturers as promulgated by the NHTSA or as designated by the appropriate state agency.


## Civil Liability

The civil liability framework envisioned by the legislation seeks to
answer a fundamental question of autonomous vehicles: if it gets into an
accident, whose fault is it? Traditional auto liability regimes
typically seek to determine which of the drivers involved in the crash
was responsible for it. If one of those drivers is a piece of software
operating various hardware autonomously, that question becomes much more
complex.

The bill proposes that Washington State adopt a novel and
forward-looking liability scheme that allows the manufacturer of the AV
system to be joined to an auto liability suit, provided that certain
preconditions are met. This approach offers a way to account for the
fact that the passenger who activates the system surrenders control of
the vehicle and thus shouldn’t be held accountable for any mistakes the
system may make.[^1] Upon showing that the system was properly
maintained and engaged at the time of the incident, the “activator” is
excused from liability and the manufacturer added. The court would then
proceed with a rebuttal presumption that the manufacturer is the liable
party. This presumption can then be rebutted by a showing that *either
the other party was the true cause of the accident or that* the
manufacturer took reasonable care to ensure crash avoidance and human
safety and did a reasonable job of ensuring the safe operation by the
consumer. *If the other party was a proximate cause, the court will
apportion blame between the manufacturer and the other driver.* *If the
manufacturer makes such a showing, the court will treat the matter as a
no-fault accident and excuse the manufacturer from the case. *

These provisions achieve three goals. First, they excuse from liability
the passenger who, although they activated the system, were not in
physical control of the vehicle at the time of the incident. Second, it
streamlines the products liability framework that would undoubtedly
arise through the common law in the absence of action by the
legislature. Finally, it creates a market incentive for AV manufacturers
to take care to ensure not just crash worthiness, but crash avoidance.
The resulting regime is one that incentivizes safety and creates
assurance that irresponsible actors will be held accountable.

## Testing 
While the public can already purchase vehicles equipped with semi-autonomous features, over 30 manufacturers are still largely in the “testing” phase of development as the industry moves towards a fully autonomous vehicle (SAE Level 5)[^features]. This presents an opportunity for Washington to become an industry leader with prompt, commercially accommodatable legislation, while improving the safety of these future vehicles for Washington residents. The unique climate of Washington relative to other major hubs of autonomous vehicle testing (i.e. California, Michigan, etc.) makes it especially beneficial to the people of Washington to encourage manufacturers to bring their testing here.[^otherstatetest] Prompt testing will improve the adeptness to the vehicles operating in Washington through improved familiarity and experience with Washington weather, terrain, and infrastructure.[^whywash] The testing regulations are divided into 3 parts: 1) application for a testing permit, 2) permit issuance, and 3) testing operation.

### 1. Application for a Testing Permit
The application for a testing permit will ensure the State of Washington is aware of autonomous vehicles being operated within the state. In order to receive a license to test, a manufacturer must submit an 8-field application to the Department of Licensing. These requirements are meant to serve specific public interests, such as: a point of contact for the manufacturer, road safety plan, privacy policy, compliance with minimum federal roadworthiness standards, and evidence of adequate insurance. A “permit” is a common requirement in other states allowing vehicle testing.[^permit]

[^permit]: http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-legislation.aspx

### 2. Permit Issuance
Rather than evaluating the technological adequacy of autonomous test vehicles, the purpose of DoL submission and review is to ensure the operational thoughtfulness and accountability of the testing manufacturer. Upon receipt of a properly filed permit application, the DoL will inform the Washington State Patrol and Chief Privacy Officer of the application to ensure the awareness of other critical areas of government related to autonomous vehicle testing. The DoL will issue a permit to each vehicle to be tested. This testing permit is an additional requirement to normal registration procedures, meaning any test vehicle must satisfy the standard registration requirements of a normal (human-operated) vehicle to test on public roadways.[^testroads]

### 3. Operation Under Testing License
A testing license only grants manufacturers the right to test their vehicle under the supervision of an employee or contractor, and does not allow for use by the general public. Operational policies balance the need for manufacturers to test their autonomous technologies in real-world conditions, while ensuring a human backup to maintain safety of the public. Additionally, manufacturers must specify in their license, or through an amendment, the exact range of capabilities and geographic regions in which they intend to test. This will ensure the public can be notified prior to the use of testing vehicles in their neighborhood. In the event a manufacturer operates without a testing license or goes beyond the scope of their license, the DoL is empowered to fine that manufacturer relative to the severity of non-compliance.


## Recognition of Other States

Autonomous vehicles licensed in other states should be able to drive into Washington without problem. Autonomous vehicles owned by state residents must be registered with the Department of Licensing, which will give the state effective notice concerning the makes and models of vehicles with autonomous capacities.

## Traffic Regulations

Autonomous vehicles and their manufacturers should be given a reasonable degree of judgment with regard to the operation of a vehicle, especially in exigent circumstances. The traffic regulations and courts have offered some reasonable standard of deviation to human drivers, and the manufacturers should be held to that same judicial standard. 

## DUI and Implied Consent

DUIs should not apply to people occupying a vehicle that does not require user intervention (SAE level 4 or 5). A level three vehicle may require an activator to resume the dynamic driving task, and therefore should not permit people to drive under the influence. 

The primary justifications and motivations behind an implied consent law for mandatory alcohol and drug testing are removed with a vehicle capable of all aspects of the dynamic driving task.


## Privacy

In the Bill there is a special consideration for privacy policy in AV, because the existing measures could not be protective enough for personal data AV treatment.

In today’s privacy legislation, personal data in AV would be generally protected when the AV company promised to protect these data in its privacy notice but instead deceived the user in doing so (FTC Act, Section 5). Thus, a preexisting privacy notice from the company is needed to activate this privacy protection. Otherwise, the AV’s user could only rely on few protections limited to specific types of data (financial and health related), leaving poorly covered many others.  

Our proposal builds on this need, and mirrors the protections of the Washington Administrative Code 284-04 for consumer financial and health information. It also construes over the Privacy recommendations of the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (NHTSA September 2016).

With the proposed Bill, the AV’s user will know exactly what data and for what purposes is being collected, will be notified when a major data breach takes place, and will be able to access AV data in case of an accident. In addition, the Bill limits the amount of data collected and the storage time to the minimum necessary, introduces data security, and encourages de-identification of personal data. Thus, the AV’s company will have to build a privacy policy and notice to its users and so, be now visible for the FTC in case of deceptive or unfair acts related to it, advancing transparency, accountability, and ultimately, consumers’ trust in AVs.

## Creation of a New Committee

The bill creates the Committee for Autonomous Technologies, Safety, and Cybersecurity (CyberCATS). CyberCATS is a double aimed Committee. On the one hand, it serves as a mean to coordinate the different departments and actors that may be involved in the safe deployment of AV, including not only governmental agents but industry. On the other hand, CyberCATS will be in charge of reviewing existing law and producing recommendations that would guide the transition from the traditional transportation system to an advanced mobility system, specifically focus on AV technologies.

AV are a new and complex technology that requires a common and coordinated effort from public authorities and private sector. AV adoption is not longer a choice, though. However, an early public policy response could shape how this technology is developed for the good of society and economy. Thus, the sooner this Committee starts its work, the better prepared the State of Washington will be, taking advantage of addressing this challenges straight away, before the appear, instead of when the factual problem arises.

The creation of CyberCATS coincides with the recommendations of the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (NHTSA September 2016), for state policy model.
